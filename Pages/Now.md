These days - I am in New York City, until beginning of January. My wife loves Christmas so going to spend Christmas and New Years eve basking the great city. 

Majority of my time these days is spent on tinkering and building Aristotle. My bet on this is that automation has sucked the life out of sales and in the next few years, we'd need to improve the core sales kills of individuals. 

Aristotle aims to do what Canva did for Design, enable anyone to be a 10x Seller. First step of this is improving their Follow up skills. This is the first iteration of the product.

Over the years - I have worked on several projects and I continue to provide active support for those projects. 

I am not open for speaking engagements these days.
